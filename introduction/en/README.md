# From Zero to Godot

## Purpose

This repository contains a series of **practical exercises in GDScript**, designed to help you learn and master the language used in the Godot Engine.

The exercises focus on developing programming logic within the context of ready-made graphical user interfaces (UI). Students interact with scene components (such as buttons, text boxes, and labels), with the sole objective of **completing the logical function** responsible for calculations or validations.

The activities cover the following topics:

* Basic mathematical operations
* Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* Loop structures (`for`, `while`)
* Creating and calling functions
* Using arrays and dictionaries
* Interacting with Classes and OOP principles

Each exercise includes:

* A **clear description of the task**
* A **ready-made graphical interface**
* A script with a **complete initial structure**, with only the exercise logic missing
* **Hints** to guide student reasoning

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)
3. Access the desired list folder (e.g., `Lista2/`)
4. Edit the script attached to the scene, completing the `TODO` function
