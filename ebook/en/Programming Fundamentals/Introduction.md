# 🚀 Welcome to Programming Fundamentals with GDScript

Welcome! If you're reading this, you probably have an incredible idea for a game in your head, but realized you need to "speak the computer's language" to bring it to reality. This material was designed to be your translator.

Many beginners try to jump straight into creating games without understanding the foundation, which results in frustration and the famous "copy and paste" without understanding what's happening. We'll do things differently.

## Your Journey Map

We've divided your learning into **4 Strategic Chapters**:

### 1. The Logical Foundation (Chapter 01)

Before we write code, let's learn to think like programmers. We'll understand what algorithms are and how to structure your logical reasoning.

### 2. The Tool (Chapter 02)

We'll dive into GDScript syntax. You'll master the variables, functions, and control structures that bring code to life.

### 3. The Architecture (Chapter 03)

Here's the heart of modern development: **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. You'll learn to organize your code using OOP concepts, which are very important to understand for using Godot's node system. You'll also learn the pillars of OOP such as Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Composition.

### 4. Memory (Chapter 04)

Finally, we'll look "under the hood." Understanding how **Memory** works and the difference between Value and Reference, which are very important concepts to understand from the beginning of your journey.
