# Algorithms

Before you start typing any code inside Godot, you need to understand what an algorithm is, which is nothing more than the strategy or plan to solve a problem. In the programming world, we often say that the computer is "dumb," because it has no initiative of its own; it only has the most basic tools to perform tasks and needs extremely detailed instructions for each action. An algorithm, therefore, works like a cooking recipe or a step-by-step guide that you give to the machine to perform a specific task.

To make it clearer, imagine you're going to teach the computer to make scrambled eggs. You can't simply say "make an egg," because the machine doesn't know what that means. The algorithm would need to detail each movement: get the eggs, get the frying pan, light the fire, break the eggs, add the seasonings, and stir until ready. In programming a game or calculator, the process is identical: to add two numbers, the algorithm dictates that first the program must read number A, then read number B, add the two into a new value C, and finally, show the result on the screen.

## Practical Algorithm Example

```
# Algorithm: Addition Calculator

Start 
  Read the first value and store it in variable A 
  Read the second value and store it in variable B 
  Calculate the sum of A plus B 
  Store the sum result in variable C 
  Display (print) the value of C on the screen 
End
```

## Rules of a Good Algorithm

There are three golden rules for an algorithm to work well on a computer:

1. **Finite**: It must have a beginning, a middle, and, necessarily, an end; it cannot run forever without completing the objective.
2. **Unambiguous**: Instructions must be precise and direct, without giving the computer room to choose what to do.
3. **Efficient**: A good algorithm uses the machine's resources intelligently to solve the proposed problem, whether it's simple like an addition or complex like finding the best path on a map.
