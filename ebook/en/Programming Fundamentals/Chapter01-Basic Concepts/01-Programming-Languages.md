# Programming Languages

## What are Programming Languages?

To start programming, the first step is to understand that programming languages work as a translator between what you want to happen and what the computer actually does. Inside, the computer is a machine that only understands electrical signals, which programmers call binary (those famous zeros and ones). Since it would be impossible for a human being to write an entire game using only these numbers, we created programming languages. They allow us to write instructions in a way that's much closer to our thinking to create software. In the end, everything you see running on your PC — from Windows and the browser to the Godot Engine itself — is software made from these logical instructions.

## Language Levels

In the history of technology, languages have evolved to become easier to use, which brings us to the concepts of "level." There are low-level languages, which are those that speak very close to the computer's hardware and are much harder to understand, such as C/C++, the language that was actually used to make Godot. On the other hand, high-level languages, like the GDScript we use in Godot, are made to be simple and straightforward, hiding all the complicated parts of the machine so you can focus only on what your game needs to do. It's as if you give a "high-level" order and the system itself takes care of translating the technical details to the processor.

## Choosing the Right Language

Each programming language is like a different tool in a toolbox: you choose the best one depending on what you want to build. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, and as a programmer, it's important to understand that there isn't one language better than another, only the most ideal language for a particular task. The coolest thing is that, although there are thousands of languages, their foundation is very similar. If you learn the logic and way of organizing commands (the so-called paradigms) in one language, you'll be able to learn any other much more easily, because the fundamental concepts end up repeating in almost all of them. If you didn't understand what these paradigms are, don't worry, just keep following along and you'll understand what I'm talking about.
