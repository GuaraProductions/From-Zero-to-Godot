# About GDScript

**GDScript** is Godot's official and native programming language, created from scratch to be the perfect tool for anyone who wants to transform ideas into games without wasting time with unnecessarily complicated code. If you've already looked at **Python**, you'll feel at home, as GDScript was heavily inspired by it, seeking clean and easy-to-read writing. It's a **high-level language**, which means it solves the technical and complex part of communication with the machine on its own, leaving you free to focus on the fun and logic of your game.

## The History of GDScript

The story of GDScript's creation shows why it's so special for Godot. In the early days of the Engine, developers tried using famous languages like **Lua** and **Python**. However, they realized that these external languages brought many challenges:

- Difficulties communicating with the Engine's "heart" (made in C++)
- High memory usage
- Lack of support for native game types, like vectors and 3D transformations

Instead of spending time trying to adapt languages that weren't made specifically for Godot, the creators decided to develop their own language, ensuring it would be fully integrated with the **Nodes** system and much faster for the developer's workflow.

## Why Use GDScript?

Although there are other options like **C#** and **C++**, GDScript remains the number one recommendation for those starting with Godot. It was designed to reduce complexity and increase your productivity, allowing you to create prototypes and complete games very quickly. If you'd like examples of games made in the Engine, I recommend checking out StayAtHomeDev's channel, where he frequently makes videos showing games made in Godot.
