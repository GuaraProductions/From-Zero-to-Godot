# Setting Up the Work Environment

Now that you understand the theory behind languages, it's time to get hands-on inside Godot. Since our focus here is to learn programming, let's go straight to the important part of the interface so you can start writing your first lines of code.

## Creating Your First Scene and Script

To get started, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a 2D Scene

We need to create a **basic Scene**, which works as the "stage" where things happen:
- In the Scenes tab, click the button to create a **2D Scene**

### 2. Attach a Script

With the scene created:
1. Look at the **Scene** tab (usually in the upper left corner)
2. You'll see an icon that looks like a small paper with a green "plus" symbol
3. This is the **Attach a new script** button - click it
4. A window will open to configure your file:
   - **Name**: Choose a name like `programming_start.gd`
   - **Template**: Choose the **Empty** option to build everything from scratch
5. Click **Create**

## The Programming Interface

As soon as you create the script, Godot's interface will automatically change to the Script view:

- **Center of the screen**: Text editor where you'll write the code
- **Bottom**: **Output Panel** - where the program talks to you, showing messages and results

With this structure ready, you already have your first script "hanging" on a scene object and are ready to create your first code! 🎮
