# 🎉 Conclusion

Congratulations! Getting here is no easy task. You started from zero, understood the logic behind algorithms, and now have the necessary foundation to start programming in **GDScript**.

I would say that with the knowledge acquired here, you already have what it takes to explore any other language. As we discussed earlier, programming languages (especially imperative ones) share very similar fundamentals. Therefore, if you've applied these concepts and understood the logic behind them, you'll be able to transfer this learning to other technologies with ease.

## What Have You Accomplished?

Look back and see your evolution:

* **Code is no longer "alphabet soup":** Now, you see it as a sequence of structured logical instructions.
* **Systemic Vision:** You know that creating a game isn't just writing loose scripts, but **orchestrating Objects and Classes** that communicate with each other.
* **Problem Solving:** You understand how to apply programming logic to solve real challenges in development.

## The Next Step

This ebook provided the tools and foundation. Now, the new challenge is to dive into the specific concepts of **game programming**. It's natural that reading this material alone won't answer all your questions about how Godot works, how to set up a character, or how to organize complex scenes.

Unfortunately, you won't find all this advanced technical content here. However, I hope this project will be expanded in the future, allowing more people to contribute with new chapters and share even more knowledge.

Until then, I invite you to get to know the **Godot** community. There are several creators producing high-quality materials that may be the missing step to your next level.

### Get to know some more names from the Godot community:

* **Godotneers**
* **Brackeys** 
* **Heartbeast** 
* **StayAtHomeDev** 
* **FinePointCGI** 
* **GameDevelopmentCenter** 
* **BeIndie - Alan Thorn**

Furthermore, practice constantly. As a programmer, you'll be in an eternal process of evolution. The more different problems you face, the more experienced you'll become. And remember: **don't be afraid to make mistakes**. Programming is the art of solving problems, and each error in the console is just one more step in your journey.

Thank you immensely for reading this ebook. I wish you great success on your journey as a developer!
